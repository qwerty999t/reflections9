When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to create a project to be share.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because there are times when you work on update, and you don't want share publically your not finished work.
