When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to create a project to be share.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because there are times when you work on update, and you don't want share publically your not finished work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is used when we want to continue to develop the project as we see it. If we clone, we copy repository from local machine or from GitHub. If we branch, we are trying to introduce new feature, so that we create a copy of project and try to modify it, without touching the prime branch.
