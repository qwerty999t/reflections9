What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When we initialize a repository we create with git additional folder that contains metadata. We need to initialize, because in this way we can then commit, change our repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	In the repository we have entire project that we want to use, we can write a message with modifications, and then use it in case of bugs or other. The working directory is where we are working now. We can expriment with it a lot. The staging area is where we can prepare our project to commit to the repository.
